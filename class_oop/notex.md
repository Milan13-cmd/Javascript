# OOP

## Object
- collection of propetries and  methods
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP


## parts of OOP
Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- INstances (new, this)

## 4 pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
### Abstraction
Hiding the complexity by providing a simple interface.
javascript  is not class based language so we have to create our own abstractions using prototypal inheritance

### Encapsulation
Data hiding: restricting direct access to some  of an object's components. A class is a blueprint for creating objects .
Data is hidden inside an object and can only  be accessed through methods provided by that object.

###  Inheritance
Creating new objects based on existing ones.

### Polymorphism
Using a single type for different data types.

## JavaScript does not have classes but it has prototypal inheritance which is closer to classical inheritance than other languages.

## JavaScript uses prototype chaining instead of  classical inheritance.
